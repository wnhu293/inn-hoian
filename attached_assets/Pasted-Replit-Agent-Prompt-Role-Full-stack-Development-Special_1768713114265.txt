Replit Agent Prompt

Role: Full-stack Development Specialist & UI/UX Designer. Project: High-end Boutique Website for "INN HoiAn" (Homestay Management & Design).

1. Aesthetic Design & Brand Identity:

Style: "Gentle, friendly, and elegant." The website should feel like a "home," not a commercial hotel.

Visual Elements: Incorporate hand-drawn icons for the contact and navigation sections, matching the "handmade" feel of the content plan. Use thin, delicate borders and soft transition effects.

Color Palette: Use a color theme: Creamy white background, warm wood tones, and light yellow accents.

Typography: Use an elegant Serif font for the headings (e.g., 'Playfair Display') and a clean, airy Sans-serif font for the main text.

2. Website Structure (Based on the Content Plan):

Homepage: The Hero section features the slogan: "INN HoiAn – Heart in every action, taste in every detail." This includes "Featured Projects" for Dù Dẻ, Camf, and Tươi.

About Us: Sections dedicated to "Operating Philosophy" (awakening the soul of a home) and "INN Team" (lifestyle portraits with hand-drawn details).

Our Journey: Lists homestays with concise, emotional descriptions:

Camf: "A second home in the heart of Hoi An, amidst the An Mỹ rice fields."

Dù Dẻ: "Cozy, rustic, and peaceful – a place for family bonding."

Tươi: "A place to breathe deeply and cast aside all worries."

Services: Displays "Management & Operations," "Business Consulting," and "Renovation."

Blog - Home Stories: A section for storytelling about "Operating Stories" and "People & Stories".

3. Functional Requirements:

Accommodation Categories: Create simple, minimalist tags for all rooms.

Booking Redirects: IMPORTANT: Do not build an internal booking system. Each "Book Now" button must redirect to the specific Airbnb link for that room.

Long-Term Stay Policy: Integrate a discount table: 1 week (-10%), 1 month (-50%), 2 months or more (-55%).

Footpage: Include an Instagram link: https://www.instagram.com/inn.hoian and a simple, easy-to-use contact form.

4. Technologies Used:

React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for smooth, fade-in motion effects).
